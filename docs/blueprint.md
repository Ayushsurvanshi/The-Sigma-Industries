## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted gold (#B8860B), representing the aluminum materials handled and the industrial nature of Sigma Industries, while avoiding garishness.
- Background color: Light, desaturated beige (#F5F5DC) offers a neutral backdrop, allowing the product visuals and key information to stand out prominently. This fits the need for a light scheme.
- Accent color: Dark orange (#A0522D). Used sparingly for call-to-action buttons and key highlights, it complements the gold and enhances user interaction.
- Font Pairing: Use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text and 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines. This pairing creates a modern, professional aesthetic suitable for an industrial brand. 
- Use a grid-based layout to organize the content. High-quality images of ladles should be interspersed. Consistent padding and margins should also be included.
- Incorporate relevant icons (e.g. industry icons or manufacturing process icons) in key areas to provide helpful visual cues to supplement copy, guide the user, and add an extra level of polish.
